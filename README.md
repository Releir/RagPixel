# RagPixel

Made this from pixel search I found in some ahk forums

Requirements
-Edited GRF with monster sprites in Green(#00FF00)
-Ranged character(preferrably high aspd and can kill mobs in couple of shots)

F1 to start
Ctrl+g is the kill switch (might need a few tries turning this off)

Made this few years ago transferred it here from gdrive.
Cheers!
